Swipeable Composable Card

This is a simple composable that uses the SwipeToDismiss from Jetpack Compose. 
With this you can easily create cards like you know it from different apps like Google Mail. 
Just swipe the card in the desired direction. Have fun, I hope I saved you some minutes of programming :)

If you are using Compose already you are good to go, otherwise add

**implementation 'androidx.compose.material:material:1.1.1'**

to your dependencies
